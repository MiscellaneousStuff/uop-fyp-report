\section{Proposed Directions for Research}

\subsection{Data Augmentation}

It might be possible to use GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) or
VAEs (Variational Auto Encoders) to create a model which can generate
more data samples.

\subsection{Improving Existing Model}

Use RL-Learning to find a model which can outperform the original model
(problem is small dataset size which means that the benfits of using RL
to create a model might not be as applicable to this problem).

Use CapsNet on top of the CNNs to improve the generalisability of the
detected EEG features (there are papers which show that these are
feasible).
