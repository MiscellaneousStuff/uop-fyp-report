The initial ASR experiments for the silent speech signals were conducted on the voiced EMG signals
on the closed vocabulary dataset. This is because it's easier to perform experiments on the voiced
EMG signals as they are parallel to the audio recordings and they contain more raw information
which makes it easier to train on.
