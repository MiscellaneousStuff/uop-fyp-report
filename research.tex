\section{Full List of Research Questions with Hypotheses}

\subsection{Data Augmentation via EMG Synthesis}
\textit{Question: How feasible is the synthesis of silent speech EMG signals
as a data augmentation technique for training EMG silent speech systems?} \\
\textit{Hypothesis: Training an EMG synthesis model based on a small
EMG dataset will improve the final performance of transduction model} \\
Measurable: Test loss of the final transduction system when trained\\
with augmented EMG data versus without\\
Measurable: Visual inspection of the synthesized EMG signals\\
Measurable: Visual inspection of the predicted mel spectrograms when
trained with augmented EMG data versus without\\

\subsection{Fine Tuning Speech Recognition on Model Predictions }
\textit{Question: Can fine tuning an ASR model on a silent speech
transduction models mel spectrogram predictions improve performance for
text classification?} \\
\textit{Hypothesis: Fine tuning an ASR model with the predicted
mel spectrograms from a pre-trained silent speech transduction model
can improve inference time and reduce the required training dataset
while maintaining competitive accuracy} \\
Measurable: WER of final system compared to SOTA for text classification \\
Measurable: Dataset size required to train the ASR system in hours \\
Measurable: Estimated end-to-end inference time for the system
