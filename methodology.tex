\section{Software Development Life Cycle (SFLC)}

The methodology selected for this project was a mixture of the
incremental and iterative software development lifecycles. This
is a typical methodology selected for machine learning projects
as the exploratory nature of many machine learning projects
necessitates a management method which allows for the flexible
changing of approaches throughout the course of the project.

At a high level, the project is managed using an incremental
approach whereby I found promising ideas from my on-going
literature review and personal exploration of the EMG silent
speech dataset.

Then when I found an approach which I believed was promising,
I conducted initial small-scale experiments to either validate
or disprove my initial assumption, and then scaled up my experiments
iteratively to verify whether or not my hypothesis was valid.

The evaluation metric for each incremental approach was selected
based on the common evaluation metric for that task as reported
in the literature.
