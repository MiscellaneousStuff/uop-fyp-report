\section{Training an ASR System on Raw Voiced EMG Signals}

\section{Justification}

The justification for this line of research is that previous attempts in
the literature have tried to classify silent EMG signals directly into text.
For instance, researchers from MIT (\cite{alter_ego_ctc})
working on a dataset recorded using the MIT AlterEgo system
(\cite{Kapur2018HumanmachineCC}) trained
a 20-word vocabulary, 200-sentence dataset for speech recognition. They
achieved a 14.8\% WER by training the model on a CNN with CTC model using
greedy decoding (choosing the word with the highest probability at each time
step). When they applied a language model on the word predictions the WER
is further reduced to 10.7\%.
