\section{Training an ASR System on Raw Voiced EMG Signals}

\subsection{Related Work}

Researchers from MIT (\cite{alter_ego_ctc})
working on a dataset recorded using the MIT AlterEgo system
(\cite{Kapur2018HumanmachineCC}) trained
a 20-word vocabulary, 200-sentence dataset for speech recognition. They
achieved a 14.8\% WER by training the model on a CNN with CTC model using
greedy decoding (choosing the word with the highest probability at each time
step). When they applied a language model on the word predictions the WER
is further reduced to 10.7\%.

However, this research used a relatively small vocabulary and utterance 
size compared to available open-source silent speech datasets. This means
that the method may not actually scale to larger datasets which means that
exploring the viability of classifying text directly from EMG signals is
a useful line of research.

\subsection{Viability Experiment}

An experiment was devised to determine how well a model could predict
text from a related EMG recording.
