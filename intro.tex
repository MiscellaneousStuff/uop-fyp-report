Vector is better (EPS or PDF) if you can manage it. If you are exporting graphs from Microsoft Excel for example, place the chart in its own sheet and print it to PDF. Then, using Acrobat or similar, crop the whitespace off the PDF. This is the most reliable way I have found to include vector graphics from Microsoft Office.
