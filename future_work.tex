\section{Implementation Errors}

\subsection{Data Augmentation via EMG Synthesis}



\subsection{Fine Tuning Speech Recognition on Model Predictions}

The experiments conducted for the fine tuning ASR approach contained
a major flaw where the ground truth ASR model was trained using
ground audio data which was transformed into raw mel spectrograms
but were refined using predicted log-mel spectrograms from the
transduction model.

A visual demonstration of the difference between these representations
was presented in Figure \ref{fig:real-gt-vs-pred-mel}. Future work
on this method should explore whether fixing this bug results in
significantly improved performance or not.
