\section{Implementation Errors}

\subsection{Data Augmentation via EMG Synthesis}

One major flaw with the model used for synthesizing EMG signals
was that the input mel spectrograms for the synthesis model were
then directly fed into the LSTM network. However all modern
machine learning approaches which process speech features such as
mel spectrograms either process the mel spectrograms into hand-crafted
features or use a convolutional neural network to learn features
in an end-to-end model. Although it's unclear how this may have affected
the proposed approach in this project, this is a fundamental flaw with
the approach that would need to corrected in any future approaches.

\subsection{Fine Tuning Speech Recognition on Model Predictions}

The experiments conducted for the fine tuning ASR approach contained
a major flaw where the ground truth ASR model was trained using
the ground truth audio data, which was transformed into raw mel spectrograms.
However, the ASR models in the experiment were then
refined using predicted log-mel spectrograms from the transduction model.

A visual demonstration of the difference between these representations
was presented in Figure \ref{fig:real-gt-vs-pred-mel}. Future work
on this method should explore whether using log-mel spectrograms for
the ground truth and predicted mel spectrograms improves performancce.
